## OpenNebula one-context port for FreeBSD

This is a Port of the one-context package which allows contextualisation of
FreeBSD VMs created using OpenNebula.

It's a port in the FreeBSD tradition so you can build a package from it
and install it on a FreeBSD system to take care of configuring the
OpenNebula-provided IP, netmask, nameservers etc.

I won't claim it's particularly well written but it seems to work for
me. Here are a the gotchas I can think of:

 * multiple NICs might not work - I assume, probably incorrectly for
   some configurations, that ifconfig will return NICs in the same
   order OpenNebula defines them. This may not be true.

 * Auto-mounting swap required some diddling with opennebula scripts
   (diff at the end) to make the swap device discernable to FreeBSD.
   There might be a better way to do it.

And finally, I only tested this on OpenNebula 4.6 (on CentOS) running
a minimal FreeBSD 10.0 image.
